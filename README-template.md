### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
-CSS3 properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
-psuedo-class and psuedo-elements

### What I learned
I recap about my knowledge about media query and most css3 properties including web font.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media only screen and (min-width:375px){
	body {
		background: url("images/pattern-background-desktop.svg") hsl(225, 100%, 94%) no-repeat;
	}

}
```

### Continued development
I will like to continue and develop in areas like CSSGRID, media queries, flex, css animations. I will like to use psuedo-class and psuedo-elements more in my next project.

### Useful resources
-My notes from different learning sources like goggle,codelibere app,instagram pages,stackoverflow.
